# Fuzzy Logic Chicken Simulator - Game AI Final Assignment

## Project Overview
A fuzzy logic-based chicken behavior simulator demonstrating autonomous agent decision-making in Godot.

## Features
- 🐔 Multiple chicken agents with fuzzy state evaluation (Hunger, Fatigue)
- 🌾 Dynamic environment with roaming areas & replenishing points
- 🏷️ Real-time UI labels showing agent states/actions
- 🔄 State succession for natural behavior transitions

## Implementation
- **Engine**: Godot
- **AI Techniques**:
  - Fuzzy logic for emotional states
  - Finite state machine
  - Autonomous navigation

## How to Run
1. Clone repository
2. Open in Godot (version 4.4)
3. Run `main_scene.tscn`
